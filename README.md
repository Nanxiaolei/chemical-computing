# Chemical Computing

![Chemical Computing](./images/primes-screenshot.png)

Please visit the lovely [documentation site](http://gigasquidsoftware.com/chemical-computing/index.html)  with lots of explanations and demos.

Experiments and explorations in Abstract Chemical Programming based on
the works of:

- [Chemical Computing - by Peter Dittrich](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11527800_2)
- [Higher-Order Chemical Programming Style by J. -P. Banâtre, P. Fradet, Y. Radenac](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11527800_7)
- [Principles of Chemical Programming by Jean-Pierre Banˆatre, Pascal Fradet and Yann Radenac](http://pop-art.inrialpes.fr/~fradet/PDFs/RULE04.pdf)
- [Programming Self-Organizing Systems with the Higher-Order Chemical Language by JEAN-PIERRE BANATRE, PASCAL FRADET, YANN RADENAC](http://pop-art.inrialpes.fr/~fradet/PDFs/IJUC06a.pdf)



## Running the examples

The examples are all in ClojureScript and using Figwheel. The directories are organized as follows:

```
- gamma
- higher-order
- dining-philosophers
- mail-system
```

You need to cd into the directory and the run `lein figwheel` to get started.  A port will open up for you so that you can open a web page at `localhost:3449`.
